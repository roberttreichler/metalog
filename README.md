The Metalog distribution are probability distributions to represent any continuous uncertainty. With metalogs, we know longer need to make assumptions around which “dead men” distributions are reasonable. Metalogs will change how 1) data is explored, 2) Bayesian inference is conducted, and 3) Monte Carlo simulation is approached. Metalogs can be used in most any situation in which CDF known and a flexible, simple, and easy-to-use continuous probability distribution is needed to represent that data.
